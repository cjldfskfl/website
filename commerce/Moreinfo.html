                    <h3>How many hours a week do lawyers work?</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>It's not uncommon for lawyers to work more than the standard amount of hours as the job requires work during weekends and late at night. Labour Market Insights conducted by the Australian Government reveal solicitors work an average of 48 hours per week. These statistics aren’t exactly reliable however as many small tasks such as answering client phone calls or communicating with colleagues won't count towards the stats though they are part of a lawyers job. Even with the right to disconnect  being added to all awards as of August 26th, our primary sources have remarked that this hasn’t been applicable to them as their clients still expect to be able to make contact after working hours.
